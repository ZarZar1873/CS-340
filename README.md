Client/Server Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
-
I think that in order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable you need to keep the program code as simple as possible, use easy to understand variable and function names, include comments that explain everything (and provide examples of how to call complex functions), and reuse code whenever possible (Like using the read function to find the results you need to update or delete in the update and delete functions.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I think whenever I approach a problem as a computer scientist, one of the first things I do is conside what data will be accessed/stored and how that data will be used to accomplish the user goals. In most of these courses I was given pretty basic data that all was going to be used in the project, whereas with this one there was a lot that was completely unnecessary for the search and rescue app. Something I would do in the future would be to limit the data being accessed to just the data needed (since only dogs were being used for the search and rescue I could have improved speed immensly by filtering out all of the other animals first)

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
-
Computer scientists solve real world problems by taking advantage of technology. This matters because it makes somethings easier (a word doc instead of a typerwriter or pen and paper) somethings possible in the first place (computing millions of possible weather conditions to give an accurate forecast), and help advance humans further into the future. By creating a system that takes in animal data from shelters all over their area, this app helps them to filter and locate animals to be trained in search and rescue. This helps shelters not be crowded, helps save lives by increasing the number or recue animals, helps the animals by giving them a home, and helps the company by saving man hours having to sift through data or call shelters.
